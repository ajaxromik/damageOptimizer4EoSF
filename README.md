# damageOptimizer4EoSF
a fully customizable damage optimizer based on the 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate set

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:         I am trying to hit 1 million damage in a video game. The math to figure out how many upgrades I
                            need is so lengthy that my math professor recommended that I try brute forcing the calculation for damage.
VERSION or DATE:            11.18.2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Run the program yourself, and if you wish to customize the variables for your character, 
                            try changing them to fit your characters.
AUTHORS:                    I am the sole author of this program.
USER INSTRUCTIONS:          The program has variables for all base values that your character might have(i.e. base attack). 
                            You can change the variables, but keep in mind that this program was developed specifically 
                            for one vaporize reaction.
